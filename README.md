# Privacy Policy for Sea Battle

**Last Updated:** 11/19/2025

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Sea Battle (the "App"). This Privacy Policy is designed to inform you about our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our mobile application.

The core principle of our data practices is minimalism and respect for your privacy. We do not engage in the extensive collection of personal data. The primary purpose of collecting any information is solely to analyze and improve the user experience within the App.

By choosing to use our App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. Information Collection and Use

For a better experience while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain minimally required information. However, this App is designed to function without the need for you to provide any personally identifiable information ("PII") such as your name, email address, or physical address.

### 2.1. Analytics Data for App Functionality and Improvement

To understand how users interact with the App, identify potential issues, and guide our development efforts towards features that users enjoy most, we utilize third-party analytics services. The information collected by these services is non-personal, anonymous, and aggregated.

This data may include, but is not limited to:

- **In-App Events and User Interactions:** We track specific actions you take within the App, such as starting a new game, making a shot, winning or losing a match, and accessing certain features.
- **Screen Flow and Navigation:** We collect data on which screens you open, the sequence of your navigation through the App, and the time you spend on different screens. This helps us optimize the user interface and flow.
- **Diagnostic Information:** We may collect non-personal information such as your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address (which is anonymized and cannot be used to identify you), device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other diagnostic data to ensure stability and performance.

## 3. Third-Party Service Providers

We employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), to provide the Service on our behalf, or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. Specifically, we use Google Analytics for Firebase as our primary analytics provider.

These third parties have access to the anonymous data described above only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. Their privacy policies govern their handling of this data, and we encourage you to review Google's Privacy Policy.

## 4. Data Retention, Sharing, and Disclosure

### 4.1. Data Retention Policy
We retain the collected analytics data only for as long as necessary to perform aggregate analysis and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our policies.

### 4.2. Strict Policy Against Data Sharing and Sale
We want to be unequivocally clear: **We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise transfer your data, whether anonymous or otherwise, to any third parties outside the App and our trusted Service Providers (like Google Analytics) as described in Section 3.**

The data collected remains entirely within the ecosystem of the App and the Google Analytics service. It is not shared with, sold to, or disclosed to advertisers, data brokers, or any other external entities.

## 5. Security

We value your trust in providing us with your minimal usage data, thus we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## 6. Children's Privacy

This App is intended for a general audience and does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to take the necessary actions.

## 7. Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites, such as links to our social media pages or other external resources. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
